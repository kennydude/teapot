## How to make it work in your application

In the AndroidManifest.xml file of your application, inside of the <application> but **not** an <activity> or any other tag add something like this:

	<meta-data android:value="myemail@gmail.com" android:name="DEVELOPER_EMAIL"/>

Other options may be added in the future depending on what you want! Add an issue if you want something (or fork + do it yourself!)
